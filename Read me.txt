This project was downloaded from GeheimerSchatz.altervista.org and there you should find the relative documentation.
This project is OpenSource and this means that you can do whatever you want with it, for commercial and not purposes.
I would like you help the improvement of TutorialMessage, releasing your changes to the project.
TutorialMessage has been developed with Visual Studio 2010 in C#. You can find a DLL to add as reference to your project withing the directory "Test".
I have also made available the dimostration of some equation used in TutorialMessage ("Dimostration.docx").
